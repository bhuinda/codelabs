Exercise 1: Very simple; I went ahead and created a new instance of class Car to test that displayInfo works.

Exercise 2: This (harharhar) is where I started to struggle because I didn't yet fully understand how 'this' and 'this' context-setting worked. I'm still learning the syntax of the bind() method and when to and when to not use it. I think I spent the most amount of time on this exercise just grasping what exactly was going on. I'm realizing now that the solution I came up with is WAY more obtuse than how I coded the same thing in Exercise 4.

Exercise 3: By using the 'extends' keyword and utilizing the super() keyword to call the constructor of the parent class, it was relatively straightforward to create subclass ElectricCar from class Car. I wonder if there exists a more elegant way to override the displayInfo method of the parent class.

Exercise 4: Not too hard; I basically applied everything I did and learned from exercise 1-3 and tested out each unique scenario that arises from how 'this' interacts with functions and arrow functions.
