Potential improvements:
- Optional background
- Change add icon
- Add transitions for item completion

Reflection:

Very happy about this one. The app building process was a breeze -- I emulated the design patterns used in the bookmark app and added all the extra functionality needed to satisfy the criteria of this app. The logic wasn't hard at all; the only real difficulty was jumping around the code and debugging typos. I learned a lot from this and I would consider this my very first complete functional web app!

I'm too lazy to find a good background image because it already looks good enough. Of all things, I still need to work on my CSS; it's a lot of memorization that I simply haven't taken the time to fully endure. ChatGPT was VERY helpful for writing a lot of the tedious CSS stuff, and I filled in all the blanks and fine-tuned things.
