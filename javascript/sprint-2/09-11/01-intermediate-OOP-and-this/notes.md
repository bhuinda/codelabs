# Exercise insights:
I'm gonna be real: this was harder than the "mastery" version of the this/OOP task! I think that's because there was more niche knowledge needed to satisfy the conditions of these exercises, like using the reduce() method, which I had a lot of fun researching and understanding. (Basically, reduce() "reduces" an array by iterating over its n-length values with input params and returns a "reduced" 1-length output.) 

3a. I wonder if there's issues organizing a playlist's metadata into arrays where the index represents the video, rather than having separate objects that represent the videos.

3b. I was really confused about how to approach this exercise and ended up with terrible code. I went to ChatGPT to have it demonstrate what the exercise wanted and what it gave me made WAY more sense, so I analyzed it, tweaked it a bit, and submitted that in the end. I've found so much value in weaponizing ChatGPT to tell me every little critical detail about what each line of code does, whether it's my code or its own generated code. I need to keep working on thinking outside the box in terms of thinking about how to operate on objects, classes, etc by using functions that are defined elsewhere.

# Video insights:
1. I don't think there's much more to be said about the 'this' video. Very well-done and very intuitive.
2. Same for the 'OOP' video. I had a very vague idea of OOP going into it and ended up enthralled with how it approaches problem-solving. Using characters with properties as a demonstration of the power of classes really hit home how OOP is useful. I plan to go back to how I was outlining the backend code of my Mafia game project and restructuring it around classes and OOP principles. I'm also curious about looking into functional programming.
