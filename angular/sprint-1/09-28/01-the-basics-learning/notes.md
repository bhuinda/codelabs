- Structural directives add/remove elements; attribute directives change an existing element.

- *ngIf allows for adding/removing elements IF a condition statement is met. Can be used with an 'else' statement but this is rare.
- ngStyle styles an element by operating on a CSS property in tandem with an expression, like a function.
- ngClass styles an element with a CSS class in tandem with an expression.

# Reflection

1. I am a HUGE fan of how the instructor breaks down all concepts into bite-sized pieces. It helps to be able to return to a video and know that what it covers is exactly the information you're looking for. He's also very articulate and does a great job of explaining the concepts without muddying the waters with theory.

2. Angular could shape future web projects by, well, shaping them. By nature it allows a developer to easily scale up and reuse code at the file level rather than the line level like in vanilla JS.

3. I grasp the topics fine, but I'm still trying to wrap my head around the syntax conventions of Angular. I think practice is the only way to make it feel more human to write and read. It makes sense at the theoretical level, but geez, it's an eyesore.
