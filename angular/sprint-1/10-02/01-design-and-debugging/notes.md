# Reflection

(Work is reflected in /projects/recipe-book)

Everything was fine and well, and the debugging segment was especially valuable for introducing sourcemaps. I did run into one major problem though, and that's the incongruency of the current Bootstrap version with the course's likely outdated Bootstrap classes, which for the most part are not applying correctly. I will try to find the Bootstrap version being used in the course so that it's a little easier to follow along.
