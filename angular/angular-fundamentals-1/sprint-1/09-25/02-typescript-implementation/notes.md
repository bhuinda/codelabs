# Reflection

I found that everything was intuitive--the key to TypeScript is simply memorizing the static typing conventions and then acting like it's vanilla JavaScript, which I've taken to smoothly thus far. I did everything right on the first try, so no challenge quite yet!

As an aside, I love the condensed class constructor() format.
