# Reflection

Integrating multiple components was easy and intuitive, but I will say that without understanding the fundamental reasoning behind how Angular works, e.g. first going into this, it seems incredibly esoteric and clunky.

I'm very excited to create large-scale projects with this new toolset! The scalability is magnitudes above vanilla JS, and having so many different ways to speak between HTML and JS is refreshing to say the least.
